Currently I'm a Software Engineer at Meta. I'm officially a Software Engineer, but I do a lot of ML too.

## Previous experience:

- Software Engineer, Ocado
Nov 2022 - July 2024

- Data Scientist, Agari
Oct 2021 - July 2022



## My Masters Dissertation, 2020

An exploratory paper in using graph clustering algorithms for hierarchical *states* in Reinforcement Learning.

- There exist many hierarchical action frameworks, e.g. Options. These string actions together to create a string of individual actions.
- However, Options require re-learning for every new state, even if the state is very similar to one previously seen.
- In this dissertation we take the novel approach to cluster the state space rather than the actions, using graph-clustering algorithms against the state graph the agent has visited.
