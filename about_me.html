<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Currently I'm a Software Engineer at Meta. I do Machine Learning and Software Engineering, and it's a really interesting space to work in.
</p>
<p>
    Previous experience:
    <ul>
        <li> 
            Software Engineer at Ocado - I loved my time at Ocado, it was there where I learned to be a Software Engineer and how to work with a real project and real specifications. 
            My work is running somewhere in a warehouse in Luton!
        </li>
        <li>
            Data Scientist at Agari - My first job, and frankly I did more ML research than Data Science. 
            At the height of the COVID pandemic, this was a weird job where I had a lot of freedom as a junior hire. I learned a lot about how *not* to do ML work.
