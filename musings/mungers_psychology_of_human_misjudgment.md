I was listening to [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Charlie%27s_Almanack) and it's a witty and self-aware compendium of speeches full of advice Charlie Munger wants to impart upon anyone who would listen.

One of the more interesting aspects is his idea of **checklists** for everything. To paraphrase him: Pilots have a checklist for everything before they take off: so should you when approaching any complex scenario.

In one speech, he fully detailed his personal checklist for the Psychology of Human Misjudgment. For a full breakdown, complete with examples, I really recommend [reading the 2005 revision here](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/). There is also the [full transcript from the original 1995 talk here](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/psychology-of-human-misjudgment-by-charlie-munger).

For a large list, see the [Wikipedia List of Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

It looks like this:

1. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency
    Incentives are aggressively important.
2. Liking/Loving Tendency
    We put effort towards things or people we like or love, sometimes causing a feedback loop. We ignore faults, like associated things, and distort facts in a Confirmation Bias way.
3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
    Opposite to liking/loving. We ignore virtues, dislike associated things, and distort facts in a Confirmation Bias way.
4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency
    We like to avoid doubt, sometimes too quickly. We make snap judgments, and sometimes don't do the hard work in order to reach a conclusion more quickly.
5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
    People tend to distort facts or change their actions to be in line with their beliefs. People tend to stick with their current beliefs. Think also of Cognitive Dissonance, which is popularly talked about.
6. Curiosity Tendency
    Humans and animals alike are curious. We like to explore.
7. Kantian Fairness Tendency
    We tend to work together, even with no incentive to, even with no expectation of future reward. Think about queueing, or cars down a one-way street.
8. Envy/Jealously Tendency
    We tend towards comparison and envy/jealousy. Munger considers this to be very strong and runs deep in our culture - many stories of tragedies begin with envy. He cites one of the ten commandments. He also discusses how it seems a taboo topic.
9. Reciprocation Tendency
    We tend towards tit-for-tat behaviour. We return favours or return hostility.
10. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency
    Association bias. We like things that remind us of other things, presumably as a form of pattern-recognition compression linked to (1) Reward and Punishment. Don't shoot the messenger. Stereotypes.
11. Simple Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
    We deny painful facts.
12. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency
    We over-estimate ourselves. Pride. Endowment Effect, we value things and ideas that we made (or think we made, in the case of idea injection).
13. Overoptimism Tendency
    We are optimistic by default. We underestimate risk. We neglect the possibility of small but disastrous events such as Natural Disasters. An extension of (11) Pain-Avoiding denial into the imagined future.
14. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency
    We hate the taking-away of something we had, or something we believed we were about to have. Includes items, includes structured belief of ideas (paired with (5) Inconsistency Avoidance). Munger sees this happen everywhere: Auctions, gambling, stock buying and selling, exploding offers.
15. Social-Proof Tendency
    We tend to follow what others do, good or bad. We use Social Proof to choose brands to buy. In essence, we have a natural belief in the Wisdom of the Crowd and a compulsion not to stand out. Leads to effects like Bystander Effect.
16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency
    We constantly compare things for reference. Think overpriced add-ons for an expensive car or holiday or phone. A small leak will sink a great ship but may not be noticed.
17. Stress-Influence Tendency
    We make bad decisions under stress. Munger discusses Pavlov's dog experiments in great detail; the dogs massively shifted in behaviour when subjected to high stress, and they stayed in that new way.
18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency
    We prefer things or information that are easy to get, and ignore things or information that is hard. "An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you." Think also of [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).
19. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency
    Skills fade and need daily practise.
20. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency
    Drugs can be destructive in many aspects.
21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
    Old age brings cognitive decline, at different times for different people. It can be kept at bay with constant learning, and accumulated wisdom and knowledge will lessen the negative impact.
22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
    We follow leaders, for bad or good. Munger cites the destruction of Germany by Hitler. Maybe a combination of effects: (4) Doubt Avoidance Tendency, (5) Inconsistency Avoidance, (15) Social Proof tendency.
23. Twaddle Tendency
    We produce unimportant slop which only distracts. Think again of [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).
24. Reason-Respecting Tendency
    We like reasons to be given for things. Munger cites an experiment: People were able to "successfully jump to the head of the lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: “I have to make some copies.”". Similar to (22) Authority-Misinfluence Tendency, as reasons have their own authority.
25. Lollapalooza Tendency—The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences from Confluences of Psychology Tendencies Acting in Favor of a Particular Outcome
    Many extreme psychological effects are simply built from combinations of these tendencies. Munger believes this is often overlooked. Some combinations are very powerful.

If you're looking for the quick version of Munger's Checklist, here it is:

1. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency
2. Liking/Loving Tendency
3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency
5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
6. Curiosity Tendency
7. Kantian Fairness Tendency
8. Envy/Jealously Tendency
9. Reciprocation Tendency
10. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency
11. Simple Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
12. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency
13. Overoptimism Tendency
14. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency
15. Social-Proof Tendency
16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency
17. Stress-Influence Tendency
18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency
19. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency
20. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency
21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
23. Twaddle Tendency
24. Reason-Respecting Tendency
25. Lollapalooza Tendency—The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences from Confluences of Psychology

I sat down for a while and I have some of my own to add, all of which are well-known in popular culture. I don't pretend that these are particularly original, but I do think they are worthy additions to the list:

1. Confirmation Bias
2. Nostalgia Effect
    Effectively (10) Association, but the known effect of nostalgia makes people like/love things more in the past, amplifying the effect.
3. Time-saving/laziness Tendency
4. Waiting Avoidance/ Immediacy Tendency
    Think of the Two Marshmallows experiment.
5. Mathematical Intuition failure
    Examples: Phone contracts over 36 months, underestimating interest rates on loans, difficult to compare 1.1^10 vs 1.05^20 and what the value really is (it's around 2.6). Causes bad decisions.
6. Tiredness Misinfluence
    Similar to drug misinfluence, but no drugs are necessary for sleep deprival. New parents should know this effect well.
7. 90% vs 100%: Looks the same at a glance.
    *Needs improvement* We tend to either not see, or not recognise the importance of, the last 10% of work needed. It looks the same from a glance and this misinforms our opinions. Think of 3D mockups making a project look good, Demos looking great in theory but never make into a real product.
8. Selfishness/close-circle benefit tendency.
    There's a well-known idea of circles of closeness. It goes roughly in order of self-family-friends-neighbourhood-area-country-world.
9. Boredom avoidance
    Boredom is a killer. In one study, people press a button that gives them an electric shock simply because they have nothing else to do.
10. Novelty Desire
    We crave novelty; think Tiktok short videos taking the world by storm.
