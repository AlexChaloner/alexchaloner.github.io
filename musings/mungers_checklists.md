I was listening to [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Charlie%27s_Almanack) and it's a witty and self-aware little book full of advice that Charlie Munger wants to impart upon anyone who would listen.

One of the more interesting aspects is his idea of **checklists** for everything. To paraphrase him: Pilots have a checklist for everything before they take off: so should you when approaching any complex scenario.

In one speech, he fully detailed his personal Psychological Effect Checklist. For a full breakdown, complete with examples, I really recommend [reading the 2005 revision here](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/). There is also the [full transcript from the original 1995 talk here](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/psychology-of-human-misjudgment-by-charlie-munger).

It looks like this:

1. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency
    Incentives are aggressively important.
2. Liking/Loving Tendency
    We put effort towards things or people we like or love, sometimes causing a feedback loop. We ignore faults, like associated things, and distort facts in a Confirmation Bias way.
3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
    Opposite to liking/loving. We ignore virtues, dislike associated things, and distort facts in a Confirmation Bias way.
4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency

5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
6. Curiosity Tendency
7. Kantian Fairness Tendency
8. Envy/Jealously Tendency
9. Reciprocation Tendency
10. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency
11. Simple Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
12. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency
13. Overoptimism Tendency
14. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency
15. Social-Proof Tendency
16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency
17. Stress-Influence Tendency
18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency
19. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency
20. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency
21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
23. Twaddle Tendency
24. Reason-Respecting Tendency
25. Lollapalooza Tendencyâ€”The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences from Confluences of Psychology Tendencies Acting in Favor of a Particular Outcome

I sat down for a while and I have some of my own to add, all of which are well-known in popular culture. I don't pretend that these are particularly original, but I do think they are worthy additions to the list:

1. Confirmation Bias
2. Nostalgia Effect
    Effectively (10) Association, but the known effect of nostalgia makes people like/love things more in the past, amplifying the effect.
3. Time-saving/laziness Tendency
4. Waiting Avoidance/ Immediacy Tendency
5. Mathematical Intuition failure
    Examples: Phone contracts over 36 months, underestimating interest rates on loans.
6. Tiredness Misinfluence
    Similar to drug misinfluence, but no drugs are necessary for sleep deprival. New parents should know this effect well.
7. 90% vs 100%: Looks the same at a glance.
    *Needs improvement* We tend to either not see, or not recognise the importance of, the last 10% of work needed. It looks the same from a glance and this misinforms our opinions. Think of 3D mockups making a project look good, Demos looking great in theory but never make into a real product.
8. Selfishness/close-circle benefit tendency.
    There's a well-known idea of circles of closeness. [TODO Cite something]. It goes roughly in order of self-family-friends-neighbourhood-area-country-world.
9. Boredom avoidance / Novelty Desire
    Boredom is a killer. [TODO link study where people literally hurt themselves out of boredom]. People crave novelty; think Tiktok short videos taking the world by storm.
